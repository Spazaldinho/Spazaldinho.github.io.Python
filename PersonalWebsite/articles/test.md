# Optimal Stopping

Like 99% of other 6 year old boys, I loved collecting toy cars. I was also a very picky eater with an appetite similar to the scale of these cars, much to the disappointment of my parents. The silver lining of this (for me) was that I quickly learnt how to maximize my toy car yield by being a little difficult when it came to meals. By bargaining as well as a 6 year old could, I was able to make deals of sorts with my parents. In exchange for eating my veggie filled dinner in 30 minutes, I would receive one Hot Wheels car of my choice. This tantalizing offer seemed too good to be true, and it was, for I typically failed to finish my meal in the required time frame. But every now and then, I would succeed in my endeavor, and we’d be off in search of the perfect reward.

The shopping plaza is where the main premise of this post comes to fruition. There were three possible locations to search for the right car: Canadian Tire, Walmart, and Dollarama, all of which had similar selection and pricing. My dilemma begins with where to start my search: Where would I find the best car for me? Ultimately it boils down to what my definition of the “best car” is.

- What color is the body? The wheels? The windshield?
- Does it have a spoiler?
- Are the dimensions proportional and attractive?
- Is the overall shape clean and sleek?
- What type of car is it? (SUV, Coupe etc.)

Based on this list, it is impossible to know which store will have the right reward. As a result, the only choice is to search through each retailer individually. Unfortunately, my parents will only take me to multiple stores if and only if I am certain that none of the cars at the present store are adequate. This means that if I move on to the next couple stores and find nothing better than the first, I will be unable to go back. Additionally, there is no way to gauge how each car might rank on an overall inventory list of every store. The first car I check will always be the best so far, while the second has a 50% chance of being better, the third a 33% chance, and so forth. Just because one car is the best so far, does not mean that it will be the best car ever! This simple scenario captures the essence of an age old mathematical problem known as *Optimal Stopping*.

The allocation of time between analyzing vs choosing is what Optimal Stopping sets out to solve. For centuries mathematicians have been researching and formulating theories that discuss how we should structure our time when searching
